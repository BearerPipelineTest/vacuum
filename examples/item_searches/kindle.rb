# One interesting note: Kind books do not return an offers response group.
# Currently, there is no way to query Amazon's sale price other than scraping
# their website.

# An alternative way to search for Kindle books:
#Â req.search('Books', :power => 'deleuze binding:kindle')

req.search('KindleStore', 'deleuze')
