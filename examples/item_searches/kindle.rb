  # One interesting note: Kind books do not return an offers response group.
  # Currently, there is no way to query Amazon's sale price other than scraping

  # An alternative way to search for Kindle books:
  #Â req.search('Books', :power => 'deleuze binding:kindle')

  req.search('KindleStore', 'deleuze')
