h1. Sucker

Sucker is a thin Ruby wrapper to the Amazon Product Advertising API. It's built on Curb and Crack.

I wrote this because ruby_aaws feels somewhat bloated and we are too lazy to conjure a straightforward way to run the latter through multiple network interfaces.

h2. Examples

Woo a worker.

bq. @worker = Sucker.new(
  :locale => "us",
  :key    => "API KEY",
  :secret => "API SECRET")

Fiddle with curl.

bq. @worker.curl { |c| c.interface = "eth1" }

Set up a request.

bq. @worker << {
  "Operation" => "ItemLookup",
  "IdType"    => "ASIN",
  "ItemId"    => ["0816614024", "0143105825"] }

Hit the Amazon API.

bq. @worker.fetch

Do something with the response.

bq. pp @worker.to_h

Hit the Amazon API again.

bq. @worker << {
  "ItemId"  => ["0393329259", "0393317757"] }
@worker.fetch

Check the integration tests in the spec folder for some more examples.
